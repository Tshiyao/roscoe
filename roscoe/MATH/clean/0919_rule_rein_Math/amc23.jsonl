A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The vertices of a regular icosahedron can be divided into two sets of 6 vertices each, such that each vertex in one set is connected to 5 vertices in the other set, and no two vertices within the same set are connected by an edge. This means that the distance between any two vertices in the same set is 2, and the distance between any two vertices in different sets is 1 or 3.\n\nLet's denote the two sets of vertices as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each containing 6 vertices. If \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are in the same set, then \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\). If \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are in different sets, then \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\).

Using \\(x^2 + y^2 = 8x\\):\n\\[\nx^2 + \\left(\\frac{2x}{5}\\right)^2 = 8x \\implies x^2 + \\frac{4x^2}{25} = 8x \\implies \\frac{25x^2 + 4x^2}{25} = 8x \\implies \\frac{29x^2}{25} = 8x \\implies 29x^2 = 200x \\implies x(29x - 200) = 0\n\\]\nThis gives us two solutions for \\(x\\): \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = \\frac{200}{29}\\). Since we are looking for the points of intersection other than the origin, we use \\(x = \\frac{200}{29}\\). Substituting \\(x = \\frac{200}{29}\\) back into \\(y = \\frac{2x}{5}\\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{200}{29}}{5} = \\frac{400}{145} = \\frac{80}{29}\n\\]\nSo, the points of intersection are \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29}\\right)\\).\n\nThe slope of the line passing through these two points is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{29} - 0}{\\frac{200}{29} - 0} = \\frac{80}{200} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nThe slope is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), and since 2 and 5 are relatively prime, the answer is \\(2 + 5 = 7\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]", "answer": "yes", "key": "amc23_23"}
