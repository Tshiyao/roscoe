Each of these digits must appear an even number of times in the entire 8-digit number. Since the year contributes 2, 0, and 2, we need the month and day to contribute an even number of each of these digits. This means that the month and day must not contribute any odd digits to the total count of the digits 2, 0, and 3.\n\nThe month can be any number from 01 to 12, and the only months that do not contribute an odd digit to the count of 2, 0, and 3 are February, April, June, September, and November.

So we use \\(y = \\frac{80}{29}\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\cdot \\frac{80}{29}}{2} = \\frac{200}{29}\n\\]\n\nThus, the points of intersection are \\(\\left(\\frac{200}{29}, \\frac{80}{29}\\right)\\) and \\((0, 0)\\). The slope of the line passing through these points is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\frac{80}{29} - 0}{\\frac{200}{29} - 0} = \\frac{80}{200} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nThe slope is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), and since 2 and 5 are relatively prime, the answer is:\n\\[\nm + n = 2 + 5 = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]", "answer": "yes", "key": "amc23_23"}
