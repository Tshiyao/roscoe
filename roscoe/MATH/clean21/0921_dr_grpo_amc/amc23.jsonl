The inequality becomes:\n\\[\n(| x | - 1) + (| y | - 1) \\le 1\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n| x | + | y | - 2 \\le 1\n\\]\n\\[\n| x | + | y | \\le 3\n\\]\n\n### Combining the Cases\nWe need to find the region in the coordinate plane that satisfies at least one of these conditions. Let's analyze each case:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( | x | + | y | \\ge 1 \\)**\n   This represents the region outside a square centered at the origin with side length 2 (since \\( | x | + | y | = 1 \\) is a diamond shape).\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( | x | - | y | \\le 1 \\)**\n   This represents the region between two lines \\( y = x + 1 \\) and \\( y = -x + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( - | x | + | y | \\le 1 \\)**\n   This represents the region between two lines \\( y = x - 1 \\) and \\( y = -x - 1 \\).\n\n4. **Case 4: \\( | x | + | y | \\le 3 \\)**\n   This represents the region inside a square centered at the origin with side length 6 (since \\( | x | + | y | = 3 \\) is a diamond shape).\n\nThe region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) is the intersection of these regions. The intersection of these regions forms a diamond shape centered at the origin with side length 2.\n\n### Calculating the Area\nThe area of a diamond (or rhombus) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{diagonal}_1 \\times \\text{diagonal}_2\n\\]\nFor our diamond, the diagonals are both 2 units long. Therefore, the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the region is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]", "answer": "yes", "key": "amc23_39"}
