This is only possible if the month is February (1 month) or one of the months with 0 appearing in the month part (8 months). However, since the digit 0 cannot appear in the month part, the only valid month is February.\n\nFor the day part, the digit 0 must appear an even number of times, which means the day must be one of the days that do not contain the digit 0 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) or one of the days that contain the digit 0 an even number of times (10, 20).

First, find the roots of the numerator and the denominator:\n\n- The roots of the numerator are \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n- The root of the denominator is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nThese roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), and \\((3, \\infty)\\). We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the fraction in that interval.\n\n1. For \\( x \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\), choose \\( x = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-(-1)(-1 - 2)}{-1 - 3} = \\frac{-3}{-4} = \\frac{3}{4} > 0\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\( x \\in (0, 2) \\), choose \\( x = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-(1)(1 - 2)}{1 - 3} = \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2} < 0\n   \\]\n\n3. For \\( x \\in (2, 3) \\), choose \\( x = 2.5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-(2.5)(2.5 - 2)}{2.5 - 3} = \\frac{-(2.5)(0.5)}{-0.5} = 2.5 > 0\n   \\]\n\n4. For \\( x \\in (3, \\infty) \\), choose \\( x = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-(4)(4 - 2)}{4 - 3} = \\frac{-8}{1} = -8 < 0\n   \\]\n\nNext, we include the points where the expression is zero or undefined. The expression is zero at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), and undefined at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}\\) is non-negative in the intervals \\((-\\infty, 0]\\) and \\((2, 3)\\).\n\nNow, we translate these intervals back to \\( n \\) using \\( x = \\log n \\):\n\n1. \\(\\log n \\leq 0\\) implies \\( n \\leq 10^0 = 1 \\). Since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, \\( n = 1 \\).\n2. \\( 2 < \\log n < 3 \\) implies \\( 10^2 < n < 10^3 \\), or \\( 100 < n < 1000 \\).\n\nCombining these, the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition are \\( n = 1 \\) and all integers from 101 to 999. Counting these, we have:\n\n- 1 integer from 1 to 100 (inclusive): 1 integer.\n- 900 integers from 101 to 999 (inclusive): 900 integers.\n\nThus, the total number of integers \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 900 = 901\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\( n \\) for which the given expression represents a real number is \\(\\boxed{901}\\).", "answer": "yes", "key": "amc23_37"}
