The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{width} \\times \\text{length}\n\\]\n\nHere, the width of the strip is 6.5 millimeters and the length of the strip is 25 meters. First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer is required in square centimeters, we will convert millimeters to centimeters and meters to centimeters.\n\n1 millimeter = 0.1 centimeters, so 6.5 millimeters = 0.65 centimeters.\n1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 25 meters = 2500 centimeters.\n\nNow we can calculate the area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 0.65 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 2500 \\, \\text{cm} = 1625 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square centimeters of paper that Jackson could cover with paint is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1625}\n\\]", "answer": "yes", "key": "amc23_34"}

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and the Rectangle:**\n   - We have a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid, which means there are 9 squares.\n   - The hidden rectangle covers 2 adjacent squares, either horizontally or vertically.\n\n2. **Possible Positions of the Rectangle:**\n   - Horizontally: The rectangle can cover any of the following pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), (7,8), (8,9).\n   - Vertically: The rectangle can cover any of the following pairs: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,9).\n\n3. **Strategy to Find the Rectangle:**\n   - We need to design a strategy that ensures we will always find at least one covered square within a certain number of turns.\n   - Let's consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it is difficult to find.\n\n4. **Worst-Case Analysis:**\n   - If we guess a square and it is not covered, we need to consider the remaining squares and the possible positions of the rectangle.\n   - For example, if we guess the center square (5), and it is not covered, the rectangle must be either horizontal or vertical and must cover squares in the remaining rows or columns.\n\n5. **Minimum Number of Turns:**\n   - To ensure we find at least one covered square, we need to consider the maximum number of turns required in the worst-case scenario.\n   - Let's start by guessing the center square (5). If it is not covered, we have 8 remaining squares.\n   - Next, we can guess one of the squares that are adjacent to the center square (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8). If any of these are not covered, we have 7 remaining squares.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring that each guess is strategic to narrow down the possible positions of the rectangle.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - By carefully choosing the squares to guess, we can ensure that we will find at least one covered square within a minimum number of turns.\n   - After several turns, we will have enough information to deduce the position of the rectangle and confirm that at least one of our guessed squares is covered.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).", "answer": "no", "key": "amc23_35"}
