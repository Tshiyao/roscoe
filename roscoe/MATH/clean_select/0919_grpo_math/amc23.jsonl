We will use the fact that any number that can be expressed as a combination of 6 and 10 can also be expressed as a combination of 6 and 10 plus multiples of 15. This is because 15 is a multiple of 5, and any combination of 10 and 6 can be adjusted by adding or subtracting multiples of 15 to get any number that is congruent to a number that can be expressed as a combination of 6 and 10 modulo 15.\n\nFirst, we find the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6 and 10. Since 6 and 10 are not coprime (they share a common factor of 2), we need to find the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 3 and 5 (the coprime parts of 6 and 10). Using the Chicken McNugget theorem for 3 and 5, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 3 and 5 is \\( 3 \\times 5 - 3 - 5 = 15 - 3 - 5 = 7 \\). Therefore, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6 and 10 is \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\) (since we need to scale back by the common factor of 3).\n\nNow, we need to check if adding multiples of 15 to 21 can form any number greater than 21. Since 15 is a multiple of 5, any number that is congruent to 21 modulo 15 can be formed by adding multiples of 15 to 21. The numbers that are congruent to 21 modulo 15 are 21, 36, 51, etc. Therefore, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a combination of 6, 10, and 15 is 29 (since 30 is a multiple of 6 and 15, and 31 is 21 + 10, 32 is 21 + 11, etc.).\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is 29.
