There are 6 possible horizontal placements (one for each row) and 6 possible vertical placements (one for each column), giving us a total of 12 possible placements.\n\nTo ensure that we cover at least one square, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it covers squares we have not guessed yet. We can use a strategy of guessing squares in a way that maximizes the information we get from each guess.\n\nOne effective strategy is to guess the center square (square 5) first. If the center square is covered, we are done. If not, we know the rectangle must be placed either horizontally or vertically, and it must cover one of the remaining 8 squares. We then guess the center square of one of the remaining possible placements. For example, if the rectangle is horizontal, we can guess square 2. If the rectangle is vertical, we can guess square 4. After this second guess, we will have either found a covered square or will have reduced the number of possible placements to a manageable number.\n\nIf the second guess is not covered, we can continue to guess squares in a systematic way, always choosing a square that will help us narrow down the possible placements of the rectangle. For example, if we guess square 2 and it is not covered, we know the rectangle must be placed vertically and must cover one of the remaining squares in the second column. We can then guess square 6, and so on.\n\nBy following this strategy, we can ensure that we will find at least one covered square in a minimum of 4 guesses. Here is a possible sequence of guesses:\n\n1. Guess square 5.\n2. If square 5 is not covered, guess square 2.\n3. If square 2 is not covered, guess square 6.\n4. If square 6 is not covered, guess square 8.\n\nAfter these 4 guesses, we will have either found a covered square or will have reduced the number of possible placements to a manageable number, ensuring that we will find at least one covered square within these 4 guesses.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
