If \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are the roots of the quadratic equation \\( t^2 - (x_1 + x_2)t + x_1 x_2 = 0 \\), then we have:\n\\[\nt^2 - 12t + 16 = 0.\n\\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 16 \\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{12^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 16}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\nThus, the \\( x \\)-coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are \\( 6 + 2\\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( 6 - 2\\sqrt{5} \\).
