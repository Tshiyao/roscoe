Since the triangle has an angle of \\(120^\\circ\\), we can assume without loss of generality that the angle opposite the side of length \\(6+2d\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\). By the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\n\\[\n(6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(6+2d)^2 = 36 + (6+d)^2 + 6(6+d)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 6d\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\n\\[\n36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 108 + 18d + d^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n3d^2 + 6d - 72 = 0\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 3, we get:\n\n\\[\nd^2 + 2d - 24 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n(d+6)(d-4) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(d = 4\\) (since \\(d = -6\\) would make the side lengths negative, which is not possible). Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are 6, 10, and 14. To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle with one angle of \\(120^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin(120^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(15\\sqrt{3}\\).
