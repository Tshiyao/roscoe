Let \\( P \\) be the weight of a large pizza in pounds, and let \\( O \\) be the weight of a cup of orange slices in pounds. We know that \\( O = \\frac{1}{4} \\) pound.\n\nThe problem states that the weight of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of a large pizza together with \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\) cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of a large pizza together with \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cup of orange slices. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P + 3 \\frac{1}{2}O = \\frac{3}{4}P + \\frac{1}{2}O\n\\]\nFirst, we convert the mixed number \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\) to an improper fraction:\n\\[\n3 \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P + \\frac{7}{2}O = \\frac{3}{4}P + \\frac{1}{2}O\n\\]\nNext, we isolate the terms involving \\(P\\) on one side and the terms involving \\(O\\) on the other side:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P - \\frac{3}{4}P = \\frac{1}{2}O - \\frac{7}{2}O\n\\]\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}P - \\frac{3}{4}P = \\frac{1}{2}O - \\frac{7}{2}O = -3O\n\\]\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so we rewrite the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{12}P - \\frac{9}{12}P = -3O\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{12}P = -3O\n\\]\nWe can cancel the negative signs and solve for \\(P\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12}P = 3O\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(O = \\frac{1}{4}\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12}P = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\nTo isolate \\(P\\), we multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{12}{5}\\):\n\\[\nP = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{36}{20} = \\frac{9}{5}\n\\]\nThus, the weight of a large pizza is \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) pounds. The problem asks for the value of \\(m - n\\) where the weight is expressed in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) with \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) relatively prime. Here, \\(m = 9\\) and \\(n = 5\\), so:\n\\[\nm - n = 9 - 5 = 4\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",

The area of circle $A$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{25\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the $5-12-13$ right triangle. Similarly, the hypotenuse of this right triangle is the diameter of circle $B$. Therefore, the diameter of circle $B$ is 13, and the radius of circle $B$ is $\\frac{13}{2}$. The area of circle $B$ is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of circle } B = \\pi \\left(\\frac{13}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{169}{4} = \\frac{169\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Area of circle } A}{\\text{Area of circle } B} = \\frac{\\frac{25\\pi}{4}}{\\frac{169\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{25\\pi}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{169\\pi} = \\frac{25}{169}\n\\]\n\nSince 25 and 169 are relatively prime, the ratio is in its simplest form. Therefore, $m = 25$ and $n = 169$, and the sum $m + n$ is:\n\\[\nm + n = 25 + 169 = 194\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{194}\n\\]",
