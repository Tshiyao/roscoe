This is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{10}{4}\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10!}{4!6!} = 210.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize. This happens if all 4 of her chosen numbers are the 4 numbers that are randomly chosen. There is exactly 1 way to choose 4 specific numbers out of 4, so there is exactly 1 way for Jen to win the grand prize.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of ways Jen can win a prize. This happens if at least 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers that are randomly chosen. We can use the complement principle to find this. First, we calculate the number of ways Jen can win no prize (i.e., fewer than 2 of her chosen numbers are among the 4 numbers that are randomly chosen).\n\n1. **Case 1: None of her numbers are among the 4 numbers that are randomly chosen.**\n   She chooses 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers. The number of ways to do this is \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\).\n\n2. **Case 2: Exactly 1 of her numbers is among the 4 numbers that are randomly chosen.**\n   She chooses 1 number from the 4 numbers that are randomly chosen and 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers. The number of ways to do this is \\(\\binom{4}{1} \\cdot \\binom{6}{3} = 4 \\cdot 20 = 80\\).\n\nSo, the number of ways Jen can win no prize is \\(15 + 80 = 95\\). Therefore, the number of ways Jen can win a prize is \\(210 - 95 = 115\\).\n\nNow, we can find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is the ratio of the number of ways she can win the grand prize to the number of ways she can win a prize:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{115}.\n\\]\n\nSince 1 and 115 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 115\\), and the sum \\(m + n\\) is:\n\\[\n1 + 115 = 116.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{116}.\n\\]",
